Please refer this official documentation regarding React-Native : https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started

                                                                                         
Few points to note during this installation

1.	Use React Native CLI instead of the expo CLI quickstart

2.	IF you are using your work laptop the port 8081 will be blocked by Mccafe for use, instead you can use any other port
You can the following command to set the port “react-native run-android --port=1234”

Try to install the app on your phone rather than a emulator, for the Speech to text implementation

Clone the app.
Run NPM install.
Run react-native run-android --port 1234
